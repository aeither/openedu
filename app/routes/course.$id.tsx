With DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support ‚Äî earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade assets, and more ‚Äî but it's faster and doesn't require paperwork or a third party. This course covers the fundamental concepts of DeFi including its benefits, risks, and major protocols.",
